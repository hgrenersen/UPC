Coursework done during my exchange semester at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya. The Bayesian Analysis Report concerns data on the winners of the Eurovision Song Contest throughout the years, and aims to estimate the different countries' probabilities of winning the competition. The project also makes use of viewership data in different European countries in a spatial model, in order to quantify the amount of variation one can expect in these numbers. The Stochastic Programming Report solves a simple stochastic program using the software AMPL using Benders decomposition.
